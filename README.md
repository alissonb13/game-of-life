# Game of Life API

This is a .NET 9 Web API that simulates [Conway‚Äôs Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), a cellular automaton where a grid of cells evolves according to a set of simple rules.

The API allows you to:
- Create and initialize boards
- Retrieve the state of a board
- Advance the board to the next generation
- Delete a board

## üì° BoardsController ‚Äî Endpoints Overview
This controller handles all operations related to the game board.

> POST /boards
Creates a new board.

Request body: JSON with board dimensions and initial cell states.

Returns: Board ID and initial state.

Example Request:
```
{
  "grid": [
    [0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
    [1, 1, 1, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  ]
}
```

> GET /boards/{id}

Retrieves the current state of a specific board.

Path Parameter: id ‚Äî ID of the board.

Returns: Current board matrix.

> GET /boards/{id}/next

Advances the board by one generation according to Conway‚Äôs rules.

- Path Parameter: id ‚Äî ID of the board.
- Returns: New state after evolution.

Rules Implemented:

1. Any live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors survives.
2. Any dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes alive.
3. All other live cells die in the next generation.
